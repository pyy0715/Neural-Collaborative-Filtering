## Keypoints
* The problem that the thesis intends to solve is to recommend the item to the user based on implicit feedback.
* Applying deep learning to user-item interaction in matrix factorization
* Using a network structure that takes advantage of both dot-product (GMF) and MLP
* Use binary cross-entropy rather than MSE as loss function
* Use point-wise loss + negative sampling
